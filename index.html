        <h1>St. Francis Prayer</h1>
        
        <p>
            Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
            Where there is <em>hatred</em>, let me sow <em>love</em>;<br>
            where there is <em>injury</em>, <em>pardon</em>;<br>
            where there is <em>doubt</em>, <em>faith</em>;<br>
            where there is <em>despair</em>, <em>hope</em>;<br>
            where there is <em>darkness</em>, <em>light</em>;<br>
            where there is <em>sadness</em>, <em>joy</em>;<br>
            <br>
            O divine Maestro,<br>
            grant that I may not so much seek<br>
            to be consoled as to console,<br>
            to be understood as to understand,<br>
            to be loved as to love.<br>
            <strong>For it is in giving that we receive,<br>
            it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br>
            and it is in dying that we are born to life.</strong><br>
            Amen.
        </p>
