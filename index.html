        <h1>St. Francis Prayer</h1>
        
        <p>
            Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
            Where there is hatred, let me sow love;<br>
            where there is injury, pardon;<br>
            where there is doubt, faith;<br>
            where there is despair, hope;<br>
            where there is darkness, light;<br>
            where there is sadness, joy;<br>
            <br>
            O divine Maestro,<br>
            grant that I may not so much seek<br>
            to be consoled as to console,<br>
            to be understood as to understand,<br>
            to be loved as to love.<br>
            For it is in giving that we receive,<br>
            it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br>
            and it is in dying that we are born to life.<br>
            Amen.
        </p>
